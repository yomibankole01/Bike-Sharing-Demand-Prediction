project description

dataset description

All the steps in sequence

Conclusion:
1. The majority of rentals are for daily commutes to workplaces and colleges. Therefore open additional stations near these landmarks to reach their primary customers.
2. We see 2 rental patterns across the day in bike rental count - first for a Working Day where the rental count is high at peak office hours (8 am and 5 pm) and the second for a Non-working day where the rental count is more or less uniform across the day with a peak at around noon.
3. Hour of the day: Bike rental count is mostly correlated with the time of the day. As indicated above, the count reaches a high point during peak hours on a working day and is mostly uniform during the day on a non-working day.
